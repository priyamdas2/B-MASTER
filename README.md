## üìÑ Paper Summary

The manuscript introduces:

- **B-MASTER** (Bayesian Multivariate regression Analysis for Selecting Targeted Essential Regressors) is a Bayesian multivariate regression framework for identifying *master predictors*.  
- The method is complemented by an efficient Gibbs sampling scheme for posterior inference, with demonstrated scalability in case studies involving up to **4 million parameters**.  
- We establish key theoretical properties:  
  1. Posterior contraction rates under standard design and sparsity conditions  
  2. Robustness under model misspecification  
  3. Row-selection consistency, ensuring reliable recovery of master predictors  
- A comprehensive simulation study highlights the superiority of **B-MASTER** over existing frequentist methods for master predictor selection, as well as over other uni- and multivariate regression techniques.  
- Applied to colorectal cancer data, **B-MASTER** identifies key microbial genera that regulate the overall metabolome profile. In addition, master predictors are investigated for two biologically relevant subsets of metabolites:  
  - The most abundant metabolites  
  - Metabolites differentially abundant in CRC
