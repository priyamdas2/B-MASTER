## üìÑ Paper Summary

The manuscript introduces:

- **B-MASTER** (Bayesian Multivariate regression Analysis for Selecting Targeted Essential Regressors) is a Bayesian multivariate regression framework for identifying *master predictors*.  
- The method is complemented by an efficient Gibbs sampling scheme for posterior inference, with demonstrated scalability in case studies involving up to **4 million parameters**.  
- We establish key theoretical properties:  
  1. Posterior contraction rates under standard design and sparsity conditions  
  2. Robustness under model misspecification  
  3. Row-selection consistency, ensuring reliable recovery of master predictors  
- A comprehensive simulation study highlights the superiority of **B-MASTER** over existing frequentist methods for master predictor selection, as well as over other uni- and multivariate regression techniques.  
- Applied to colorectal cancer data, **B-MASTER** identifies key microbial genera that regulate the overall metabolome profile. In addition, master predictors are investigated for two biologically relevant subsets of metabolites:  
  - The most abundant metabolites  
  - Metabolites differentially abundant in CRC

### üïí Approximate Computation Time

Running B-MASTER for 1,000 iterations (sufficient for posterior sample‚Äìbased inference) on a dataset with dimensions P = 287, Q = 249, and N = 220 -- matching the case study data -- takes approximately **100‚Äì120 minutes** to complete. This benchmark was obtained on a **Windows 10 Enterprise** system with **32 GB RAM** and a **12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700** processor (12 cores, 20 logical threads, 2.10 GHz base frequency).
